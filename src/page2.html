        <h2>Special Moves</h2>
        <h3>Pawn's Special Moves</h3>
        <p>
          The pawn has two special moves: <i><b>En Passant</b></i> and <i><b>Promotion</b></i>
        </p>
        <section class="pawn-promotion" id="pawn-promotion">
          <h4>Promotion</h4>
          <img src="images/boards/pawn-promotion.png" alt="Pawn Promotion" width="250">
          <img src="images/boards/pawn-promotion.gif" alt="Pawn Promotion GIF" width="250" class="gifs">
          <p>
            A pawn that reaches all the way to the opposite side of the chess board can be promoted to another piece of choice, such as queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
            This is called <u>promotion</u>.
            The Queen is the most popular choice for promotion.
            The choice of promotion is not limited to capture pieces: players can have 10 queens on the board!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="pawn-en-passant">
          <h4>En Passant</h4>
          <img src="images/boards/pawn-en-passant.png" alt="Pawn En Passant" width="250">
          <img src="images/boards/pawn-en-passant.gif" alt="Pawn En Passant GIF" width="250" class="gifs">
          <p>
            An unusual special move is the 'en passant' capture. This takes place when a pawn uses its initial move option to advance two squares instead of one, and when doing so passes over a square that is threatened by an enemy pawn.
            That enemy pawn, then has the option of capture the moving pawn as if it had only move one square.
            Then the enemy pawn moves to the empty square that the captured pawn had passed over.
            This is called <u>En Passant</u>.

        <h3>King's and Rook's Special Move</h3>
        <section class="castling" id="castling">
          <h4>Castling</h4>
          <img src="images/boards/king-castling.webp" alt="Castling" width="250">
          <img src="images/boards/king-castling.gif" alt="Castling" width="250" class="gifs">
          <p>
            With the Rook, the King can make a special move called <u>castling</u>.
            In castling, the king moves two squares towards one of its rooks and then the rook is placed on the other side of the king.
            Castling consists of moving the king two squares on its first row toward either one of its rooks, then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed.
            In order to castle, the following conditions must be met:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The King cannot be in check nor pass through check.</li>
            <li>Neither the king nor the rook must have moved previously.</li>
            <li>There cannot be any pieces in between the king and the rook.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Ways a Chess Game Can End</h2>
        <h3>Win/Lose</h3>
        <p>A game can be won or lost in the following ways:</p>
        <h4>Checkmate</h4>
        <a href="./page1.html#check-and-checkmate"><img src="images/boards/checkmate.gif" alt="Checkmate GIF" width="250"></a>
        <p>
          <a href="./page1.html#check-and-checkmate">Checkmate</a> occurs when the king is in check and the player has no legal move.
          Click the GIF above to learn more about checkmate.
        </p>
        <h4>Resignation</h4>
        <p>
          Resignation occurs when a player resigns, perhaps because they are in a hopeless position.
        </p>
        <h4>Win On Time</h4>
        <p>
          In games with a time limit, a win on time occurs if the opponent runs out of time, regardless of who is winning.
        </p>
        <h3>Draw</h3>
        <p>There are multiple ways where a game can result in a draw:</p>
        <h4>Stalemate</h4>
        <img src="images/boards/stalemate.gif" alt="Stalemate GIF" width="250">
        <p>
          If the player to move has no legal move, but is not in check, a stalemate has been achieved.
        </p>
        <h4>Insufficient Material/Dead Position</h4>
        <img src="images/boards/dead-pos.png" alt="Dead Position" width="250">
        <p>
          If neither player is able to checkmate the other player just move using a legal move, the game is drawn.
          This state of the game is called a <u>Dead Position</u> or <u>Insufficient Material</u>.
        </p>
        <h4>Draw by Agreement</h4>
        <p>
          This is a type of draw where there is a mutual agreement between the players to draw.
        </p>
        <h4>Threefold Repetition</h4>
        <img src="images/boards/repetition.gif" alt="Repetition GIF" width="250">
        <p>
          This type of draw occurs when neither player is able to avoid repetitive moves or are constantly making repeating moves.
        </p>
        <h4>Fifty-move rule</h4>
        <p>
          If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, it's a draw.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="notation">
        <h2>Notation</h2>
        <p>
          There is a notation to record chess moves. The system of notation used today is the <u>short-form algebraic notation</u>.
          Each square is indentified with a set of coordinates, a-h for the columns followed by 1-8 for the rows.
          <br>
          <br>
          The format is:
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>initial of the piece moved - column of destination square - row of destination square</i>
          <br>
        </p>
          <h3>Initials of Pieces</h3>
          <table style="width:25%">
            <tr>
              <th>Piece</th>
