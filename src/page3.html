        <h2>Elo Rating System</h2>
        <img src="images/other/elo.png" alt="Chess Elo Rating System" width="500">
        <p>
          The Elo Rating System measures the relative strength of a player in chess.
          The creator of this chess rating system is Arpad Elo, who was a physics professor in the United States.
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Each chess player's Elo rating is represented by a number that reflects that person's results in previous rated games.
          After each rated game, the players' ratings are adjusted according to the outcome of their game.
          <br>
          <br>
          Contrary to popular belief, the Elo rating system does not measure a player's absolute strength.
          The rating system only calculates the probable outcome of a person's games against other players.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a general rule of thumb, if a player is rated 100 Elo points higher than their opponent, there is a 64% chance they will win.
          If a player is rated 200 Elo points higher than their opponent, there is a 75% chance they will win.
          <br>
          <br>
          Another feature of this system is that the rating gap determines the amount of Elo points they can win or lose.
          Since a higher-rated player is more likely to win, they do not receive a lot of points for victory against a lower-rated player. Their opponent also does not lose that many points.
          On the other hand, when the lower-rated player wins, this is considered way more significant and that lower-rated player's Elo points is increased significantly. However, the higher-rated player is penalised accordingly.

        <h2>Grandmasters (GM)</h2>
        <img src="images/other/grandmaster.png" alt="Chess Grandmaster" width="500">
        <p>
          Apart from the title of world champion, the GM (Grandmaster) title is the highest that a chess player can achieve. Once earned, the title is held for life.
          The title is awarded by the International Chess Federation (FIDE).
          GMs are the strongest chess players in the world, and even very talented players must prove themeselves in difficult tournaments to achieve the GM title.
          <br>
          <br>
          These are the top 10 chess players in the world:

        <h3>Who Earns the GM Title?</h3>
        <p>
          FIDE currently awards the title of GM to a player who achieves a 2500 Elo rating.
          In May 2020, there were just 1770 active GMs.
          A completely unofficial term, "super-grandmaster" or "super-GM" refers to a player with a 2700+ Elo rating.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is the Super-GM Hikaru Nakamura:

        <p>
          It's 1997, and the world watches in astonishment as GM Garry Kasparov, arguably the best chess player in history, loses a match against a computer. The era of chess engines has started.
          <br>
          <br>
          A chess engine is a computer program that analyzes chess positions and returns what it calculates to be the best move options.
          This is the Komodo engine:
        </p>

        <p>
          Chess engines are much stronger than any human grandmasters, with the best of them reaching an estimated Elo rating of more than 3000.
          Engines are also getting stronger each year due to improvements in hardware and software.
        </p>
        <h3>Popular Chess Engines</h3>
        <p>
          There are many chess engines, but only a few of them reach at the top.
        </p>
        <h4>Stockfish</h4>
        <img src="images/other/stockfish.png" alt="Stockfish" width="250">

        <img src="images/other/deepmind.png" alt="Deepmind Logo" width="250">
        <p>
          AlphaZero was developed by DeepMind, an artificial intelligence and research company that was later acquired by Google.
          However, it is not publicly available.
          AlphaZero shocked the world after easily defeating Stockfish.
          <br>

        <p>
          Komodo is one of the dominant and most successful interface chess engine on the market.
          Don Dailey developed it in 2010, and Mark Lefler kept working on it in 2013.
          Chess.com acquired Komodo in 2018.
          The engine's ability to run at different playing strengths, with different styles and opening books, has made it a popular choice among players.
